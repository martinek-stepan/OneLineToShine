# One Line to Shine
One Line to Shine to shine is semester project for an iOS course I have taken at the University of Southern Denmark. The requirements for the project were to make an application or game that utilize some kind of sensor.

I have decided to create a game based on one-line drawing, where the drawing is done with physical movement utilizing GPS.
In the game, the player selects pattern he wants to draw and can adjust it with rotation and pinch to make all points accessible.

When the game starts, the player can lock/unlock points that are less than 5 meters away from him. It is only possible to lock a point when it is neighbour with last locked point (or is the first point user is trying to lock).
